Dynamic Routing System Test Cases

This module contains test cases for the dynamic routing system's core functionality.
Expected Test Results:

1. Sample Delivery Generation:
   - D1-D5 (Random weights 500-3000kg): Should PASS
   Reason: System should handle random delivery generation

2. Truck Movement Simulation:
   - T1 (Delhi): Should PASS (movement simulation)
   - T2 (Mumbai): Should PASS (movement simulation)
   - T3 (Bangalore): Should PASS (movement simulation)
   - T4 (Chennai): Should PASS (movement simulation)
   Reason: System should simulate truck movements correctly

3. Delivery Assignment:
   - All deliveries (D1-D5): Should PASS if:
     * Weight â‰¤ Truck Capacity
     * Truck available in appropriate location
     * No conflicting time windows
   - May FAIL if:
     * Weight exceeds truck capacity
     * No suitable truck available
     * Time window constraints not met
   Reason: System should properly assign deliveries based on constraints

4. Route Visualization:
   - All routes: Should PASS
   Reason: System should generate valid visualizations

Note: The actual results may vary based on:
- Random delivery generation
- Current system state
- Truck availability
- Time of execution
- System load
